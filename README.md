* **vs Other Redis Plugins**: Comparable speed with better compatibility

## Why Smart Exclusions Matter

### The Problem
Traditional caching plugins cache everything, which can cause conflicts:
* Real-time data gets cached when it shouldn't be
* External plugins can't manage their own caching
* Dynamic content becomes stale
* E-commerce and betting data becomes outdated

### Our Solution  
Ace Redis Cache intelligently identifies and excludes:
* **Time-Sensitive Data** - Live betting odds, stock prices, real-time feeds
* **User-Specific Content** - Personalized data, shopping carts, user dashboards  
* **External Plugin Data** - Let specialized plugins handle their own caching
* **API Endpoints** - Dynamic data sources that need real-time updates

### Real-World Example: Bet-API Integration
The bet-api plugin has sophisticated caching for real-time betting data:
* **Short cache durations** (60 seconds) for live odds
* **Fallback mechanisms** between persistent cache and transients  
* **API-specific cache warming** and management
* **Time-sensitive data** requiring precise cache control

By excluding bet-api data, we ensure:
‚úÖ No conflicts between caching systems  
‚úÖ Real-time betting data stays fresh
‚úÖ Bet-api's cache management works properly
‚úÖ Redis focuses on basic WordPress content for speed

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Redis required on my server?
Yes, you need a Redis server running. Most hosting providers offer Redis, or you can install it yourself. The plugin will gracefully degrade if Redis is unavailable.

### Will this conflict with my existing caching plugin?
Ace Redis Cache is designed to work alongside other caching plugins by using smart exclusions. However, for best performance, use only one caching solution.

### Can I customize what gets excluded?
Yes! The plugin includes developer hooks and filters to add custom exclusion patterns for your specific needs.

### Does this work with WooCommerce?
Absolutely! The plugin automatically excludes cart pages, checkout, and other dynamic e-commerce content while caching product pages and static content.

### What happens if Redis goes down?
The plugin includes graceful fallback - if Redis is unavailable, WordPress continues to function normally using standard caching methods.

### Is this compatible with multisite?
Yes, Ace Redis Cache fully supports WordPress multisite installations with per-site configuration options.

### How do I know it's working?
Check the plugin's status dashboard for connection status, cache statistics, and hit/miss ratios. You can also look for `X-Cache: HIT` headers in your browser's developer tools.

### Installation & Usage

1. Ensure Redis is running on your server
2. Configure connection settings in **Settings ‚Üí Ace Redis Cache**
3. **Keep exclusion settings enabled** (default and recommended)
4. Test the connection and monitor cache performance

### Technical Details
