## Why Enterprise-Grade Reliability Matters

### The Problem with Basic Caching
Traditional caching plugins fail in production environments:
* **Redis Connection Failures**: Site goes down when Redis is unavailable
* **Blocking Operations**: KEYS commands freeze Redis under load
* **No Failover**: Single point of failure with no graceful degradation
* **Memory Issues**: Large cache flushes cause memory spikes and timeouts
* **Plugin Conflicts**: Aggressive caching breaks specialized plugin functionality

### Our Enterprise Solution  
Ace Redis Cache handles real-world production challenges:

#### Connection Resilience
* **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatically bypasses Redis during outages
* **Automatic Reconnection**: Transparent healing of broken connections
* **Connection Pooling**: Reuses connections across requests for efficiency
* **Timeout Protection**: Prevents slow Redis responses from affecting users

#### Performance Under Load
* **SCAN Operations**: Non-blocking key enumeration that won't freeze Redis
* **Chunked Processing**: Handles millions of cache keys without memory spikes
* **Persistent Connections**: Eliminates connection overhead in high-traffic scenarios
* **Background Operations**: Cache maintenance doesn't block user requests

#### Production Reliability
* **Graceful Degradation**: Site continues working even if Redis fails completely  
* **Zero Downtime**: Plugin updates and Redis maintenance don't affect visitors
* **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error logs for proactive monitoring
* **Header Debugging**: `X-Redis-Retry` and cache status headers for troubleshooting

### Real-World Example: High-Traffic News Site
A news site with 100,000+ daily visitors needs:
✅ **Intelligent Block Caching** - Latest posts stay fresh while static content is cached  
✅ **Connection Pooling** - Handles traffic spikes without connection exhaustion
✅ **Circuit Breaker** - Redis maintenance doesn't take the site offline
✅ **Custom Exclusions** - Breaking news widgets update in real-time
✅ **Performance Monitoring** - Debug headers help identify cache optimization opportunities

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this require a Redis server?
Yes, you need Redis 5.0+ or AWS ElastiCache/Valkey running locally or remotely. The plugin includes graceful fallback - if Redis becomes unavailable, your site continues working normally using WordPress's built-in caching.

### What happens during Redis outages?
The plugin uses a **circuit breaker pattern** - if Redis fails, it automatically bypasses caching for 60 seconds, then gradually re-attempts connection. Your site never goes down due to Redis issues.

### Can I use Unix sockets for better performance?
Yes! Set the Redis Host to a file path (e.g., `/var/run/redis/redis.sock`) for local connections. This provides 20-30% better performance than TCP connections.

### How does AWS ElastiCache/Valkey TLS work?
Enable the TLS checkbox and the plugin automatically configures SNI (Server Name Indication) for proper certificate validation. Use port 6379 for both TLS and plain connections - the plugin handles TLS negotiation automatically.

### How does Block-Level Caching work?
In Object Cache mode, you can enable block-level caching which caches individual WordPress blocks (paragraphs, images, widgets) separately. This allows dynamic blocks (latest posts, comments) to stay fresh while static content remains cached.

### Will this conflict with other caching plugins?
The plugin is designed with intelligent exclusions to coexist with specialized plugins. However, for optimal performance, disable other full-page caching solutions and use this as your primary cache.

### Is it compatible with WooCommerce and e-commerce?
Absolutely! The plugin automatically excludes cart pages, checkout, user-specific content, and includes `woocommerce/*` blocks in auto-exclusions. Static product pages and catalog content get cached for performance.

### How do I monitor cache performance?
The admin dashboard shows real-time statistics including cache size, hit/miss ratios, and connection status. Look for `X-Cache: HIT/MISS` headers in your browser's developer tools, and `X-Redis-Retry: 1` headers indicate automatic reconnections.

### Can I customize what gets cached vs excluded?
Yes! The plugin supports four types of custom exclusions:
- **Cache Keys**: Exclude by key prefix patterns
- **Transients**: Exclude transients with wildcard matching  
- **Content**: Skip pages containing specific strings
- **Blocks**: Exclude WordPress blocks by name or pattern

### Is this production-ready for high-traffic sites?
Yes, the plugin is built for enterprise environments with:
- AWS ElastiCache/Valkey production support with TLS+SNI
- Connection pooling and persistent connections
- Circuit breaker pattern for automatic failover
- SCAN operations instead of blocking KEYS commands
- Chunked processing for large datasets
- Comprehensive error logging and system diagnostics

### How does it compare to premium caching plugins?
Ace Redis Cache offers comparable or better performance with additional enterprise features like automatic failover, connection pooling, AWS ElastiCache/Valkey TLS support, and granular block-level caching. It's specifically designed for reliability in production environments.

* **Encryption in Transit**: Enable in ElastiCache settings and use TLS checkbox in plugin
* **AUTH Token**: Optional Redis AUTH password for additional security layer

### Troubleshooting AWS Connections

#### Common Connection Issues
**TLS Handshake Failed**: Check that "encryption in transit" is enabled in ElastiCache settings and TLS checkbox is enabled in plugin.

**Connection Timeout**: Verify security groups allow port 6379 between EC2 and ElastiCache. Use the System Diagnostics tool to test connectivity.

**Certificate Validation Errors**: The plugin automatically configures SNI for proper certificate validation. Ensure system CA certificates are up to date.

**High Latency Warnings**: ElastiCache in different AZ may show higher latency. Consider using ElastiCache in same AZ as WordPress server.

#### Using System Diagnostics
The plugin includes comprehensive diagnostics accessible from the admin dashboard:
1. **Test Redis Connection**: Verify basic connectivity and measure RTT
2. **System Diagnostics**: Comprehensive connection, TLS, and network testing
3. **Test Write/Read**: Verify Redis operations work correctly
4. **Connection Status**: Real-time monitoring with performance indicators

#### Debug Headers
Monitor cache performance using browser developer tools:
- `X-Cache: HIT/MISS` - Cache status
- `X-Cache-Mode: full|object` - Current caching mode  
- `X-Redis-Retry: 1` - Automatic reconnection occurred

### Does it support WordPress Multisite?
Yes, the plugin is fully compatible with WordPress multisite installations. Each site can have independent cache settings and exclusion patterns.

### What about TLS/SSL connections to Redis?
The plugin supports secure Redis connections with full TLS+SNI support. Simply enable the TLS checkbox and the plugin handles certificate validation, SNI configuration, and secure connections automatically. Perfect for AWS ElastiCache with "encryption in transit".
